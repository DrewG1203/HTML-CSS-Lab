    <h1>Anime</h1>


    <h2>What is anime?</h2>

    <div class="text">
        <p class="google">Anime is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from Japan. Outside of Japan
            and in English,
            anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan.[1] However, in Japan and in Japanese, anime (a
            term
            derived from a shortening of the English word animation) describes all animated works, regardless of style
            or
            origin. Animation produced outside of Japan with similar style to Japanese animation is commonly referred to
            as
            anime-influenced animation.</p>

        <p class="google">The earliest commercial Japanese animations date to 1917. A characteristic art style emerged
            in the 1960s
            with
            the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in following decades, developing a large domestic audience.
            Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the
            Internet.
            In addition to original works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or
            video
            games. It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences.

            Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent
            technologies. It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and
            individualistic techniques. Compared to Western animation, anime production generally focuses less on
            movement,
            and more on the detail of settings and use of "camera effects", such as panning, zooming, and angle shots.
            Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite varied, with a common
            characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes.

            The anime industry consists of over 430 production companies, including major studios such as Studio Ghibli,
            Sunrise, Bones, Ufotable, MAPPA, CoMix Wave Films and Toei Animation. Since the 1980s, the medium has also
            seen
            international success with the rise of foreign dubbed, subtitled programming and its increasing distribution
            through streaming services. As of 2016, Japanese animation accounted for 60% of the world's animated
            television
            shows.</p>

        <p class="google">As a type of animation, anime is an art form that comprises many genres found in other
            mediums; it is
            sometimes
            mistakenly classified as a genre itself. In Japanese, the term anime is used to refer to all animated works,
            regardless of style or origin. English-language dictionaries typically define anime (/ˈænɪmeɪ/) as "a
            style of Japanese animation" or as "a style of animation originating in Japan". Other definitions are
            based on origin, making production in Japan a requisite for a work to be considered "anime".

            The etymology of the term anime is disputed. The English word "animation" is written in Japanese katakana as
            アニメーション (animēshon) and as アニメ (anime, pronounced [a.ɲi.me]) in its shortened form. Some sources
            claim that the term is derived from the French term for animation dessin animé ("cartoon", literally
            'animated
            drawing'), but others believe this to be a myth derived from the popularity of anime in France in the late
            1970s and 1980s.

            In English, anime—when used as a common noun—normally functions as a mass noun. (For example: "Do you watch
            anime?" or "How much anime have you collected?") As with a few other Japanese words, such as saké and
            Pokémon, English texts sometimes spell anime as animé (as in French), with an acute accent over the final e,
            to
            cue the reader to pronounce the letter, not to leave it silent as English orthography may suggest. Prior to
            the
            widespread use of anime, the term Japanimation was prevalent throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In the
            mid-1980s,
            the term anime began to supplant Japanimation; in general, the latter term now only appears in period works
            where it is used to distinguish and identify Japanese animation.</p>
