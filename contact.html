    <h1>Manga</h1>

    <h2>What is Manga?</h2>

    <div class="google2">
        <p>Manga (Japanese: 漫画 [maŋga]) are comics or graphic novels originating from Japan. Most manga conform to a
            style developed in Japan in the late 19th century, and the form has a long prehistory in earlier Japanese
            art. The term manga is used in Japan to refer to both comics and cartooning. Outside of Japan, the word is
            typically used to refer to comics originally published in the country.</p>

        <p>In Japan, people of all ages and walks of life read manga. The medium includes works in a broad range of
            genres:
            action, adventure, business and commerce, comedy, detective, drama, historical, horror, mystery, romance,
            science fiction and fantasy, erotica (hentai and ecchi), sports and games, and suspense, among others.
            Many manga are translated into other languages. Since the 1950s, manga has become an increasingly major part
            of the Japanese publishing industry. By 1995, the manga market in Japan was valued at ¥586.4 billion ($6-7
            billion), with annual sales of 1.9 billion manga books and manga magazines in Japan (equivalent to 15 issues
            per person). In 2020 Japan's manga market value hit a new record of ¥612.6 billion due to the fast growth of
            digital manga sales as well as increase of print sales. Manga have also gained a significant worldwide
            audience. Beginning with the late 2010s manga started massively outselling American comics. In
            2020 the North American manga market was valued at almost $250 million. According to NPD BookScan manga made
            up 76% of overall comics and graphic novel sales in the US in 2021. The fast growth of the North American
            manga market has been attributed to manga's wide availability on digital reading apps, book retailer chains
            such
            as Barnes & Noble and online retailers such as Amazon as well as the increased streaming of anime.
            According to Jean-Marie Bouissou, manga represented 38% of the French comics market in 2005. This is
            equivalent
            to approximately 3 times that of the United States and was valued at about €460
            million ($640 million). In Europe and the Middle East, the market was valued at $250 million in 2012.</p>

        <p>Manga stories are typically printed in black-and-white—due to time constraints, artistic reasons (as coloring
            could lessen the impact of the artwork) and to keep printing costs low—although some full-color manga
            exist (e.g., Colorful). In Japan, manga are usually serialized in large manga magazines, often containing
            many
            stories, each presented in a single episode to be continued in the next issue. Collected chapters are
            usually
            republished in tankōbon volumes, frequently but not exclusively paperback books. A manga artist (mangaka in
            Japanese) typically works with a few assistants in a small studio and is associated with a creative editor
            from
            a commercial publishing company. If a manga series is popular enough, it may be animated after or during its
            run. Sometimes, manga are based on previous live-action or animated films.</p>

        <p> Manga-influenced comics, among original works, exist in other parts of the world, particularly in those
            places
            that speak Chinese ("manhua"), Korean ("manhwa"), English ("OEL manga"), and French ("manfra"), as well as
            in
            the nation of Algeria ("DZ-manga").</p>
