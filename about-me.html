    <h1>The Big Three</h1>

    <h2>What is The Big Three?</h2>

    <div class="text">
        <p>The Big Three was a term used to describe the three most popular running series during their golden age in
            Jump's
            mid 2000s period - <strong>One Piece, Naruto and Bleach.</strong></p>

        <p>The nickname <em>"The Big Three"</em> came about due to their immense worldwide popularity and length. With
            that, they
            were always featured in front of the shared Shonen Jump covers and always had bigger images for their main
            protagonists: Luffy, Naruto and Ichigo.</p>

        <p>While the three series weren't the biggest sellers in the magazine, Hunter x Hunter sold more per volume than
            Bleach for example, they kept their position on the covers due to their overall popularity.</p>

        <p>These three manga have each received long running anime series, Bleach has 366 episodes, Naruto (+Shippuden)
            has
            720 episodes, and One Piece has 1000 episodes as of November 2021, with One Piece and Boruto, Naruto
            Shippuden's
            sequel, still airing. These statistics do not include the spin-offs, sequels, and movies, so the full
            numbers
            for entire franchises are higher.</p>

        <p>All three are shonen series, which usually focus on topics such as adventure, growth, and action. This genre
            normally has a lot of subplots and one main, overarching plot. Fighting is also a main part of most shonen
            series: the protagonists almost always have a superpower and are very muscle headed in nature.</p>

        <p>The Big Three tend to attract similar audience so it's likely that fans of one series will at least try to
            check
            out the rest.</p>

        <p>Sometimes fans discuss what the Big Three of other genres could be, or try to find a New Big Three for
            shonen.
            During Bleach's decline in sales and popularity, Toriko rose to popularity and started to become featured in
            front of Bleach on the shared Jump covers, effectively taking its place in the big three. Soon after Toriko
            &
            Bleach started to lose popularity and eventually end alongside Naruto, other series became featured more
            often
            in front with One Piece, including - My Hero Academia, Haikyuu, Assassination Classroom, and recently
            Kimetsu no
            Yaiba, but its unlikely that there will ever be other three simultaneously running series that would be able
            to
            challenge the original big three in popularity.</p>

        <p> During the Golden Age of Weekly Shonen Jump, when its circulation was at its peak, according to fans a "Big
            3"
            equivalent for early 90s would be Dragon Ball, Slam Dunk and Yu Yu Hakusho. While late 90s equivalent would
            be
            One Piece, Rurouni Kenshin and Hunter x Hunter.</p>
